# DuPont Tedlar Lead Generation - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the implementation details for the DuPont Tedlar Lead Generation AI Agent prototype. The system automates the process of identifying, qualifying, and initiating outreach to potential leads for DuPont Tedlar's Graphics & Signage team.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with four main components:

1. **Data Collection Module**: Gathers information about industry events, associations, and participating companies.
2. **Lead Qualification Module**: Evaluates companies against DuPont Tedlar's Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
3. **Stakeholder Finder Module**: Identifies key decision-makers at qualified companies.
4. **Personalization Engine**: Generates tailored outreach messages for each stakeholder.

These components work together in a pipeline, with the output of each stage serving as input to the next.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Collection Module

The `data_collection.py` module is responsible for gathering information about relevant industry events, associations, and potential leads.

**Key Features:**
- Event scraping to identify industry events relevant to DuPont Tedlar
- Association data collection to identify potential industry connections
- Company extraction from event exhibitor lists and association memberships
- Data enrichment to add context to company information

**Implementation Notes:**
- In the prototype, event and association data is pre-configured in `config.yaml`
- The module generates synthetic exhibitor and member data
- In a production implementation, this would integrate with actual web scraping and API calls

### 2. Lead Qualification Module

The `lead_qualification.py` module evaluates companies against DuPont Tedlar's ICP criteria to identify the most promising leads.

**Key Features:**
- Company data enrichment with revenue and employee information
- ICP-based scoring across multiple dimensions (industry fit, size, keywords, engagement)
- Qualification rationale generation to explain scoring decisions
- Prioritization of leads by overall score

**Scoring Dimensions:**
- **Industry Score**: Evaluates alignment with target industries (0-10)
- **Size Score**: Assesses company size based on revenue and employees (0-10)
- **Keyword Score**: Measures relevance based on detected keywords (0-10)
- **Engagement Score**: Evaluates participation in events and associations (0-10)

**Implementation Notes:**
- The prototype uses a weighted average to calculate overall scores
- Companies with an overall score ≥ 7.0 are considered qualified leads
- In a production implementation, this would integrate with external data providers

### 3. Stakeholder Finder Module

The `stakeholder_finder.py` module identifies and evaluates key decision-makers at qualified companies.

**Key Features:**
- Stakeholder identification based on relevant titles and departments
- Title matching to prioritize stakeholders by relevance to DuPont Tedlar
- Seniority scoring to focus on higher-level decision-makers
- Interest area generation to support personalized outreach

**Stakeholder Evaluation:**
- **Title Match Score**: Measures alignment with target titles (0-10)
- **Seniority Score**: Evaluates the stakeholder's level in the organization (0-10)
- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of title match and seniority (0-10)

**Implementation Notes:**
- The prototype generates synthetic stakeholder data
- In a production implementation, this would integrate with LinkedIn Sales Navigator or similar platforms

### 4. Personalization Engine

The `personalization.py` module generates tailored outreach messages for stakeholders based on company and stakeholder information.

**Key Features:**
- Personalized outreach message generation for each stakeholder
- Subject line generation for email communications
- Incorporation of company and stakeholder context in messages
- Reference to events and associations to establish relevance

**Personalization Elements:**
- Company name and industry context
- Stakeholder role and interests
- Event participation and association memberships
- Specific value propositions based on interests

**Implementation Notes:**
- The prototype uses template-based personalization
- In a production implementation, this would leverage a language model API (e.g., OpenAI)

## Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. **Initial Data Collection**:
   - Event data → `events.json`
   - Company data → `companies.json`

2. **Lead Qualification**:
   - `companies.json` → Lead qualification process → `qualified_leads.json`

3. **Stakeholder Identification**:
   - `qualified_leads.json` → Stakeholder finder → `stakeholders.json`

4. **Outreach Generation**:
   - `stakeholders.json` → Personalization engine → `leads_with_outreach.json`

5. **Dashboard Visualization**:
   - `leads_with_outreach.json` → Streamlit dashboard

## Dashboard Implementation

The dashboard is implemented using Streamlit and provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and acting on lead data.

**Key Features:**
- Lead overview with filtering capabilities
- Detailed company and stakeholder information
- Visualizations of lead scores and qualification rationales
- Email preview and sending capabilities
- Event and association context

**Implementation Notes:**
- The dashboard uses Streamlit for rapid prototype development
- In a production implementation, this could be enhanced with additional visualizations and CRM integrations
